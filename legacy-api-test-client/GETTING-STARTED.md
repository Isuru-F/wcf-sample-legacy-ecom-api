- **Separation of concerns** - Clean, maintainable code
- **Independent solution** - Won't be affected by API changes
- **Zero external dependencies** - Just .NET and the WCF services

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not connect to service"**
- Ensure WCF services are running: `netstat -an | findstr 8732`
- Check firewall settings

**"Service contract mismatch"**
- API contracts may have changed
- Regenerate service proxies if needed

## Next Steps

1. Try creating a few customers and products
2. Run the regression test suite (option 6)
3. Customize the sample data in `Models/SampleData.cs`
4. Add new test scenarios as needed
